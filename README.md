# Slither-Storage
a repository with all of the things I have collected, this is mostly for me to be able to keep data when I move

the .z64 files are nintendo 64 roms and rom hacks, run them in neilb.net/n64wasm

there are images

there are thousands of proxy links

and that's basically it lol

(exploits and links are decoded in base64)
