The code is a simple proxy core ripped from a program called Lithium.js. I have condensed it into a very small file.

1. Go to an html editor, I use https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro
2. Delete the code in the box, and paste the proxy core.
3. Press run.
4. Profit!

Notes
Try going to gointerstellar.app inside of the proxy, it is very useful. The core cannot run certain sites such as GitHub and Discord, but Interstellar can.
